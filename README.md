# Megan - PA Facility Air Pollution ReadME
**<u>Source:</u>** https://www.kaggle.com/jaseibert/us-facilitylevel-air-pollution-20102014

**<u>Objective:</u>**

Identify air pollution trends (Greenhouse Gases only) & top offenders by county utilizing facility data from Kaggle data set.

**<u>Limitations of Data Set:</u>**

These emissions figures are only from facilities -- not, for instance, vehicles -- and only for those facilities required to report (generally larger facilities). Here's what the EPA says about the two programs: ""The GHGRP  generally <u>requires facilities that emit above 25,000 metric tons CO2e</u> [carbon  dioxide equivalents] of GHGÂ’s <u>to report their emissions</u>. Therefore this data set does not reflect total U.S. emissions or total emissions from individual states. **Roughly 50% of total U.S. emissions are reported by large emitting  facilities subject to the GHGRP**."

**<u>Outcomes:</u>**

On average from 2010-2014, only 21.2% of facilities listed in the data set reported their CO2e emissions.
